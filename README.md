# Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC)

Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) is an approach that leverages the dynamics of quantum systems for machine learning tasks, such as time series prediction and classification. It's inspired by classical reservoir computing, which uses a fixed, high-dimensional system (the reservoir) to transform input data into a rich representation for easy processing by a simple readout layer.
QRC harnesses quantum properties like superposition and entanglement, offering potential advantages such as high-dimensional embeddings and efficient representation of complex patterns.

## Key Concepts

1. **Reservoir Computing Basics**:
   - A reservoir is a high-dimensional system that transforms input data into a rich representation.
   - A simple readout layer (e.g., linear regression) maps the reservoir's output to the desired result.

2. **Quantum Advantage**:
   - Quantum systems naturally operate in exponentially large Hilbert spaces.
   - They provide powerful reservoirs with efficient representations of complex patterns.

3. **QRC Workflow**:
   - **Initialization**: Prepare a quantum reservoir (e.g., a quantum circuit or quantum system).
   - **Encoding**: Encode classical input data into the reservoir.
   - **Evolution**: Let the quantum reservoir evolve, generating a quantum state.
   - **Measurement**: Measure the quantum state to obtain classical features.
   - **Readout**: Train a classical model (e.g., linear regression) to map the features to the output.
